\title{
Get the Best Covariate Index
}
\description{
\code{GetIndex} gives the best covariate index according to the inputed data set. The best covariate is one out of the candidate covariates considered that gives the largest Q statistic value.
}
\usage{
GetIndex(dat_current,
          JJ,
          rate = 1,
          method = "DR",
          SoP = 10,
          howGX = "SpecificGX",
          const = NA)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dat_current}{ A data frame. This data frame has the first four columns: individual IDs, the instrument, the expoure, and the outcome with the candidate covariates following.
}
  \item{JJ}{A positive integer indicates the total number of the candiate covariates.
}
  \item{rate}{a value ranging from 0 to 1 indicates the proportion of the candidate covariates to be randomly cosidered in each split when construcing the Q-tree.}
  \item{method}{a character indicates the stratification method used for constructing a Q-tree. There are currently three methods: the Doubly-ranked method (\code{method='DR'}), the residual methods (\code{method='Residual'}) and the naive method (recognized by any character except \code{'DR'} and \code{'Residual'}). The default method is \code{'DR'}.
}
  \item{SoP}{a postive integer (>=2) indicates the size of pre-straum. Only applicable for the doubly-ranked stratification. Default value is 10.
}
  \item{howGX}{a character indicates the way to calculate the instrument-exposure associations. Two ways are currenly allowed: the instrument-exposure associations estimated seperately at each stratum (\code{howGX='SpecificGX'}), or use a fixed instrument-exposure association (\code{howGX='const')}
}
  \item{const}{a value indicates the fixed instrument-exposure association value used for constructing the Q-tree. Only applicable for \code{howGX='SpecificGX'}.
}
}
\details{
\code{GetIndex} helps to decide the splitting covariate at the present node when constructing a Q-tree.
}
\value{
\code{GetIndex} returns a vector with the following three values:'Candidate.index', 'Q.value' , 'node.size'
\item{Candidate.index }{The index (position rank) of the chosen covariate.}
\item{Q.value}{The corresponding Q statistic value of the chosen covariate.}
\item{cnode.size}{The present node size. If \code{GetIndex} is not used for constructing Q-trees, this value simply means the size of the inputed data.}
