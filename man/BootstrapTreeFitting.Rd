One Bootstrap Q Tree Fitting
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
\code{BootstrapTreeFitting} fits the Q-tree for a bootstrap data of the training set (with user specific seed) and store the cleaned results. If you do not need results but the original (dirty) Q-tree information, you may use \code{GetTree()}.
}

\arguments{
\item{seed}{seed value for reproducible and traceable results}
\item{Odat}{a data frame. This is recognized as the trainging data set.}
\item{Vdat}{a data frame. This is recognized as the testing or validation data set.}
\item{S}{a postive integer indicates the maximum tree depth allowed. Default value is 5 (i.e. the data set is allowed to be splitted at most 5 times). \code{S} is also conneted to the argument \code{endsize}, both of which work in a similar way. One may only restrict one of them and leave another one be a flexible value (e.g. \code{S=100} or \code{endsize=0}). }
\item{rate}{a value ranging from 0 to 1 indicates the proportion of the candidate covariates to be randomly cosidered in each split when construcing the Q-tree.}
\item{Qthreshold}{A positive value used as the threshold value for the Q statistic. Default value is 3.0. One can set \code{Qthreshold=0} to ignore the Q-related stopping rule.}
\item{method}{a character indicates the stratification method used for constructing a Q-tree. There are currently three methods: the Doubly-ranked method (\code{method='DR'}), the residual methods (\code{method='Residual'}) and the naive method (recognized by any character except \code{'DR'} and \code{'Residual'}). The default method is \code{'DR'}. }
\item{SoP}{a postive integer (>=2) indicates the size of pre-straum. Only applicable for the doubly-ranked stratification. Default value is 10. }
\item{howGX}{a character indicates the way to calculate the instrument-exposure associations. Two ways are currenly allowed: the instrument-exposure associations estimated seperately at each stratum (\code{howGX='SpecificGX'}), or use a fixed instrument-exposure association (\code{howGX='const'})}
\item{endsize}{a positive integer value indicates the minimual size of the node of Q-tree. \code{S} and \code{endsize} work in a similar way.}
\item{const}{a value indicates the fixed instrument-exposure association value used for constructing the Q-tree. Only applicable for \code{howGX='SpecificGX'}.}

\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The training data \code{Odat} and the testing data \code{Vdat} should be of the same form and be a data frame that can be regonized by the functions. The first four columns must be the individual IDs, the (one-dimensional) instrument, the exposure (should be \code{NA} if not available), and the outcome, respectively. The (high-dimensional) covariates are then follwing. Note that all the functions may be working with incorrect column ordering, but the results are misleading. Do make sure the column variable order is correct.

If simulated data is used, there should be a end column named as true_STE. That is, \code{odat$true_STE} is not \code{NULL}.

If the data does not contain the exposure information, the RFQT can still be fitted, where one should use \code{howGX='const'} with a external instrument-exposure association (usually from independent studies).
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
\code{BootstrapTreeFitting} returns a list with the following components:

\item{OOB_predict}{the predicted effects of the OOB samples accrding to the Q-tree. Values will be 0 if the individual is not out of bag. }
\item{v_predict}{the predicted effects of the testing samples accrding to the Q-tree.}
\item{vi1}{the vector of the variable importance (VI) measurements for all the candidate covariates considered.}
\item{vi2}{the vector of the variable importance (VI) measurements for all the candidate covariates considered. This VI measurements do not need the individual true effect information, therefore suitable for real application data.}
\item{ts1}{the value of the permutation test with statistic S1.}
\item{ts2}{the value of the permutation test with statistic S2.}

When the real data is fitted, \code{vi1} is not applicable. When only traning data is available, \code{v_predict} is not applicable.
